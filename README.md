How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure functionality and security I can run tests on my software before launching to production and ensuring it is encrypted with security features to ensure no one can access it. 
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I can provide surveys periodically for users of the program to ask for feedback on their expierences and where I can make improvments. 
How do I approach designing software?
I tackle designing software by gathering notes on what the clients goals are for the program, what the users needs are going to be, and setting goals for myself on what to complete to bring the whole program together.
